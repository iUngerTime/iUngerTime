I am a senior in Software Engineering at Oregon Institute of Technology. My graduation date is June 2021! As a student, and on my own, I have had the opportunity to learn a broad spectrum of skills and I am looking forward to using those skills to create industrial solutions. Currently, I am interested in developing technologies like automated driving, working with defense contractor technologies such as drones, medical technologies such as bionics are also remarkably interesting to me. Overall, I want my career to make a difference. In addition to my technological interests, I continuously learn new hobbies and adapt them into my life. Hobbies such as: snowboarding, rock-climbing, skydiving, wood working, drawing, and learning new languages.
