### About Me

![Email](https://img.shields.io/badge/-iungertime.github.io-lightgrey?style=for-the-badge&)

I am a Sofware Engineering Manager at Buildable. Graduated in Software Engineering at Oregon Institute of Technology in June of 2021. I have had the opportunity to learn a broad spectrum of skills and apply them to industrial solutions. I used an agile process to develop, and maintain products.

Currently, I am interested in developing technologies like automated driving, working with defense contractor technologies such as drones, medical technologies such as bionics are also remarkably interesting to me. Overall, I seek to make a difference. In addition to my technological interests, I continuously learn new hobbies and adapt them into my life. For example: snowboarding, rock-climbing, skydiving, wood working, drawing, and learning new languages.
